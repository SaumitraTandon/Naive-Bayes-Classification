## Introduction

The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and is particularly effective for high-dimensional data. This notebook demonstrates how to implement and evaluate a Naive Bayes classifier using Python's `scikit-learn` library.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive-bayes-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd naive-bayes-classifier
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook naive_bayes.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the implementation and results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, which contains information about users' social network activities and whether they purchased a product. The features include:

- Age
- Estimated Salary
- Purchased (target variable)

## Results

The notebook includes sections that split the dataset into training and test sets, train the Naive Bayes model, and evaluate its performance. The results include metrics like accuracy and visualizations of the decision boundaries.
